# Assignment 1

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for Assignment 1 located in the `assignment_1` folder. The notebook includes all the necessary code and documentation for the assignment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.x recommended)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository (Optional)**

   If you have Git installed, you can clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:University-of-Utah-Rich/CS6220.git
   ```

   If you don't have Git, you can simply download the repository as a ZIP file from GitHub and extract it on your computer.

2. **Navigate to the Assignment Folder**

   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `assignment_1` folder within the cloned or downloaded repository:

   ```
   cd path/to/your-repository/assignment_1
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

   It's recommended to create a virtual environment for Python projects. This keeps dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated environments for them. You can create a virtual environment by running:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Notebook

After installing the prerequisites and navigating to the `assignment_1` folder:

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   or

   ```
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. Jupyter will open in your default web browser. Navigate through the interface to `assignment1.ipynb` and open it.

3. You can now run the notebook cells one by one by selecting each and pressing `Shift + Enter`, or you can run the entire notebook by using the appropriate command in the Jupyter interface.
